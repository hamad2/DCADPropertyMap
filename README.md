# DCAD Parcel Viewer (Demo)

This is a small and incomplete Parcel Viewer for the Dallas Central Appraisal District (DCAD).

## Technologies Used

- **Visual Studio 2022**
- **.NET 8 Blazor WebAssembly**
- **Bootstrap 5.1**
- **Esri JavaScript SDK 4.29 (Latest)**

## Data Sources

- **DCAD REST Services**
- **Google Imagery Map** (Note: Imagery map may not display due to API key restrictions)

## Features

- **Search Widget**: This demo utilizes the Esri SearchWidget for searching parcels. In a real-world application, a custom search implementation would be recommended.
- **Imagery Display**: Displays parcel imagery using the DCAD ImageryParcel Map Service.

## Development Decisions

Initially, Leaflet was considered for this project. However, the Esri JavaScript SDK was chosen for its comprehensive GIS capabilities and seamless integration with Esri services.
