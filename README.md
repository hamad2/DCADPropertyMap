This is a very small and incomplete Parcel Viewer for DCAD

 - Software used: Visual Studio 2022 Net 8 Blazor WebAssembly ArcGIS
 -  Esri Javascript SDK 4.29 (Latest) 
 - Data From DCAD Rest Folder. Google
 -  Imagery Map( it may not show due to the API Key)

 -  I decided to use the SearchWidget for this demo,   but in a real application we should implement Custome Search.

At first I thought Leaflet will do the job,  then I decided to to use Esri JS SDK.


Clone the Repo:
Open it in visual Studio 2022 or visual studio Code with Net 8 SDK installed
build and RUN
